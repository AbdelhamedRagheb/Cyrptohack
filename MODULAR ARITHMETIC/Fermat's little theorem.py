Fermat's little theorem
states that if p is a prime number, 
then for any integer a, the number (a^p - a) is an integer multiple of p. In the notation of modular arithmetic, 
this is expressed as
 -> a^p = a (mod p)

If a is not divisible by p, 
that is, if a is coprime to p, then Fermat's little theorem is equivalent to the statement that
